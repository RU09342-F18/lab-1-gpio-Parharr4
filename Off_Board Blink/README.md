# Off Board Blink
 Using the microprocessor we use an LED to blink. I used pin 1 for power, pin 16 for reset and pin 20 ground. Pin 2 was the output for the both LEDs. There is a reset button connected within the circuit with parallel capacitoors and resistors for a bypass to make the button presses more consistent.

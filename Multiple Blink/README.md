# Multiple Blink
Board blinks two different LEDS at two different speeds and at a 50% duty cycle.


# YOU NEED TO CREATE THE FOLLOWING FOLDERS
* MSP430G2553
* MSP432P401R

## CODE
 For the G2553 you set PIN1.0 and PIN1.6 as outputs and than a while loop that iterates multiple times till the if statements are parsed as true. While for the P401R you use PIN1.0 and PIN2.1 as outputs instead and the same methodology is used.

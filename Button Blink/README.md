# Button Blink
Get a button on the DEV Board to activate the LEDSs. To do this a pull down resistor is used to get rid of the remaining charge in the circuit. The button resets after the delay cycles finish parsing through and once they finish it will be ready for another button press. Holding down the button will have the same effect as pressing the button when the delay cycle finishes every single time, effectively making a blinker.
